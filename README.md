# Extra Long Factorials

Extra Long Factorials JavaScript Solution

# Function Description
The function calculates and print the factorial of a given integer
For example
if n = 30, we calculate 30 x 29 x 28 x .... x 3 x 2 x 1 and gets 265252859812191058636308480000000

> **Note:** Functions of n > 20 can't be stored even in a 64 - bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
